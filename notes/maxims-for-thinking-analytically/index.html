<h4 id="when-you-are-having-trouble-getting-your-thinking-straight-go-to-the-extreme-case">When you are having trouble getting your thinking straight, go to the extreme case</h4>
<ul>
<li>Helpful in the following situations
<ul>
<li>To undestand a concept, problem, or idea
<ul>
<li>Identify outliers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To assess the best-case or worst-case consequences of a decision
<ul>

<h4 id="when-trying-to-understand-a-complex-real-world-situation-think-of-an-everyday-analogue">When trying to understand a complex real-world situation, think of an everyday analogue</h4>
<ul>
<li>Memorable everyday analogue to effectively communicate ideas</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-world-is-much-more-uncertain-than-you-think">The world is much more uncertain than you think</h4>

<li>&ldquo;Uncertainty, not risk, is the difficulty regularly before us&rdquo; - Richard Zeckhauser</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ignorance is an important phenomenon, I would argue, ranking alongside uncertainty, and way above risk. Ignorance achieve its importance, not only by being widespread, but also involving outcomes of great consequence.&rdquo; - RZ</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="think-probabilistically-about-the-world">Think probabilistically about the world</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understanding what subjective probability actually mean
<ul>
<li>Based on judgement, not measured</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assign probabilities to many things, such as events, in our lives to help us make decisions
<ul>
<li>Quantitative over verbal (likely, unlikely)</li>
